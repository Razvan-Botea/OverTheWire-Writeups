## Bandit Level 3

## Level goal

The password is stored in a file called --spaces in this filename--, in the home directory

## Solution

    - because it begins with a special character, we need to specify the path to the file
    - it also has spaces so we need to put it inside ""
    - cat ./"--spaces in this filename--"
