- for this level the concept is similar, but the input is filtered, and i cannot use the following characters: ;&|
- another way to make the server print not intended things is to give the grep command two files to search through
- i also need to give it a string to search for, and for this to work and print the password, the strings needs to be part of the password
- so i need to try different letters, until i get the password
- here is the command i used:
	- a /etc/natas_webpass/natas11
- and the password

# Password
