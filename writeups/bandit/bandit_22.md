## New concepts learned
    - cron = a shell command for scheduling a job (command or script) to run periodically at a fixed time, date, or interval
    - The actions of cron are driven by a _crontab_ (cron table) file. The crontab files are stored where the lists of jobs and other instructions to the cron daemon are kept
