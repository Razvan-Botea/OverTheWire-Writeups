## Bandit Level 5

## Level goal
    The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the **inhere** directory

## Solution

    - use "cd" to go to the **inhere** directory
    - the file names start with "-" so we use file ./"numele_fisierului" to print the type for each file
    - only "-file07" contains ASCII text
    - use "cat ./-file07" to retreive the password

## Password
    - 4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw

## New concepts learned
    - file = determine the type of a given file
